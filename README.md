📊 Business Problem

A retail company has high sales volumes but shrinking profits. The leadership team suspects poor pricing strategies and excessive discounting. The goal: Identify what’s killing profits and where to act.


🔧 Tools Used

Excel: Data cleaning, formatting, initial pivot analysis

Power BI: Advanced analysis, visualizations, DAX calculations


❓ Key Client Questions Answered

1. Why are profits low even though sales seem good?

🔍 Analysis Performed:

Compared Sales vs Profit across categories and sub-categories

Calculated and visualized Profit Margin

Analyzed Average Discount vs Profit trends

🔎 Insight:

Sales are strong, but high average discounts (16%) are shrinking margins. Some categories (e.g., Furniture) are heavily discounted yet barely profitable.


2. Which regions are killing our profits?

🔍 Analysis Performed:

Profit by Region and City (Map Visual)

Filtered views of top loss-making areas

🔎 Insight:

Certain cities in North America and Europe show red flags — good sales but negative profit. These are likely discount-heavy or high-cost delivery areas.


3. Which product categories/sub-categories are underperforming?

🔍 Analysis Performed:

Profit by Sub-Category chart

Listed Top 10 loss-making products

🔎 Insight:

Products like Cubify CubeX 3D Printers and Lexmark Monochrome Printers contribute the most losses. Tables and Bookcases also show consistently negative profits.


4. Are our discount strategies backfiring?

🔍 Analysis Performed:

Scatter plot: Discount % vs Profit

Profit trend by Discount Bracket

🔎 Insight:

Discounts above 30% rapidly reduce profit. While these drive volume, they severely impact net gains.


5. What product segments should we push more?

🔍 Analysis Performed:

Ranked Top 10 profit-making products

Filtered by Low Discount + High Profit products

🔎 Insight:

Products like Canon imageCLASS 2200, Fellowes Punch Machines, and HP DesignJet Printers deliver high margins with minimal discounts.


6. How can we increase profits next quarter?

🔎 Recommendations:

❌ Stop promoting high-discount, low-profit products like 3D Printers

⬆️ Focus on high-margin products with minimal discount dependency (e.g., Canon, HP, Fellowes)

🌍 Re-evaluate pricing and promotions in loss-making regions

⚠️ Set a maximum discount threshold (e.g., 20%) to protect margins


🌟 Outcome & Learnings
